Local Weather App. A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/SW1992/pen/Myqary.

Built With HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery & Javascript.

Uses the HTML 5 Geolocation API & the Open Weather API to get a users position & give them weather data based on that.

It works in Edge & Firefox, but i've yet to find a work around for Chrome.

Currently, Chrome is blocking the HTML 5 Geolocation API from getting the users location. 

I will update this as i find a solution.
